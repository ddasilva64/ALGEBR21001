# Operations between polynomials



### Addition and subtraction of polynomials

**When adding or subtracting polynomials**:

* A polynomial is solved in the same way as a monomial, only with more terms. The recipe is always to locate like terms first. Once located, we can add or subtract depending on what the problem asks we
* It's important when subtracting to express polynomials between parenthesis signs to be clear that the minus is affecting and changing the sign of everything inside the parentheses that comes after the subtraction. Remember to change the sign only to the expression we are subtracting, the one on the right

## Operations between monomials

### Multiplicaci√≥n

**We must take into account when we're multiplying**:

* The number that accompanies the variable (letter) or precedes it's the coefficient, which is a constant and multiplies the variable
* When you've expressions with the same base (same letter), their exponents are added

### Division

**We must take into account when dividing between monomials**:

* The coefficient that accompanies the variable divides normally
* The law of exponents tells us that when we divide expressions with the same base (letter), the exponents will be subtracted. The denominator is subtracted from the numerator
